- *R-squared*: Measures the model's goodness of fit.
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*: Evaluates the model's prediction accuracy.
- *Cross-Validation Score*: Assesses the model's generalization performance.

*Usage*

1. *Clone the repository*: Use Git to clone the project repository.
2. *Install required libraries*: Install necessary libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas.
3. *Run the Jupyter notebooks*:
    - *data_preprocessing.ipynb*: Preprocesses the data.
    - *model_development.ipynb*: Develops and evaluates the models.
4. *Explore the results and insights*: Analyze the predicted outcomes and feature importance.
